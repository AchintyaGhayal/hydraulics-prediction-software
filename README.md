Predictive optimization for industrial hydraulic systems â€” paper + code for efficiency gain modeling and setpoint recommendations
# Hydraulic Efficiency Optimizer

Predictive optimization framework for industrial hydraulic systems.  
**Paper:** `paper/hydraulic_efficiency_preprint.pdf` (also on Zenodo/OSF).

## Features
- Efficiency-gain prediction from operating parameters (pressure, flow, temp, RPM, load)
- Simple recommendations for improved setpoints
- Reproducible experiments via notebooks

## Quick Start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
